This is the 3rd project in my **Data Structures and Algorithms** university course.

The program is made up of 4 parts: **graph representation**, **binary min heap**, **Dijkstra algorithm** and effectively creating permutations using **Heaps algorithm**.

Full documentation in Slovak is in the file called _dokumentacia.pdf_
